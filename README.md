<p> Follow Lineum through a journey of daydreams,
magical salads, building a business, and 
national competitions.  Will magic be the key 
for Lineum to conquer big data, or will it come down to math?</p>

        <a href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/~king/">Dr. Emily King</a> is an Associate Professor in the <a href="https://mathematics.colostate.edu">Department of Mathematics</a> at Colorado State University, hired as part of a data science cluster hire.  Before that, she was a professor at the University of Bremen in Germany, leading the research group Computational Data Analysis. Dr. King is on the editorial board of Scatterplot: the MAA Journal of Data Science and is in general passionate about teaching data science and the mathematics of data science.  Dr. King's research includes data science, (algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial methods in) frame theory, signal &#38; image processing, and pure &#38; applied harmonic analysis. <!--Unlike James, she knows that Hamel bases are not useful in applications outside of mathematics. -->

James' favorite class is Linear Algebra which he has taught since 2003.  His main research areas are Algebra and Computation, especially the study of tensors.  <!--James prefers his vector spaces to be finite and doubts that all vector spaces have a basis, but has learned to get along with people who imagine otherwise.-->  James has spent more than a decade in research collaborations with industry and government labs and regularly contributes to state-of-the-art mathematical software systems.  James is also on the editorial board of the Journal of Algebra and has been a member or chair of Open Educational Resource committees for more than a decade.  Above he is pictured next to William Rowan Hamilton, the inventor of the "vector" and "tensor".  James is the one in color.
